### [2_1](./2_1)
Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.  
FOLLOW UP  
How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?  

(1) Solution1: Use set to store the data and find the duplicate.  
(2) Solution2: Use two pointer to iterate the list. (Not implementd)
### [2_2](./2_2)
2.2 Return Kth to Last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.  

(1) Solution1: Use iterative to count the amount of nodes from the end. (Not implemented)  
(2) Solution2: Use two pointer which have k node in between,  
### [2_3](./2_3)
Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but  
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to  
that node.  
EXAMPLE  
lnput:the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f  
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a ->b->d- >e- >f  

(1) Solution1: if Given the head node, use two pointer, one is twice faster than another, so get the middle node.  
(2) Solution2: if NOT given the head node, delete the next node by copying the data from next node. (Not implemented)
