# CrackingTheCodes
## Description
To practice the coding skills, I created this repo for solving the questions in cracking the codes interview. The language is C++, and I will also write simple test functions to test the result.
## Structure
####  Top layer
(1) Main.cpp: runs the test for the question. Changing the including files and test name can run different test.
(2) Common.cpp and Common.h is for common functions throughout the whole exercises.  
####  Second layer
(1) Chapter folder: contains the exercises in this chapter.
(2) ChxCommon.cpp and ChxCommon.h is for common functions throughout this chapter exercises.
####  Third layer
(1) Exercise folder: contains the test function and solution for the question.
